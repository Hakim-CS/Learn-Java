# Learn Java

Welcome to the **Learn Java** repository! This repository contains my solutions, practice projects, and notes as I learn Java. The exercises cover a variety of topics, from basic syntax to object-oriented programming and algorithmic challenges.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into folders and files, each corresponding to a different exercise or project. Many exercises are inspired by the [Exercism Java track](https://exercism.org/tracks/java), as well as custom problems for deeper learning. Example files include:

- `Greeter.java` â€” A simple "Hello, World!" example.
- `Students.java` â€” A project to manage student grades, demonstrating input handling, classes, lists, and calculations.
- `String_matching.java` â€” An example of implementing a string matching algorithm in Java.
- `GreeterTest.java` â€” Example of using JUnit for unit testing.

Each directory or file contains the code solution, and may include additional notes or resources.
